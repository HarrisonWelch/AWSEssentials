# Scalable architectures

1 of the most impactfule abilities is automatic scaling of infrastructure

* scaling of out, in, up, down

* Scaling out
  * horizontal increase
  * more nodes
  * handling increase in traffic
* Scaling in
  * horizontal decrease
  * less nodes
  * less traffic, release nodes
* Scaling up
  * verical increase
  * resources are added to increase ability of a node(s)
  * increase CPUs in processing or Memory of DB
* Scaling down
  * verical decrease
  * resources are removed to decrease ability of a node(s)
  * decrease CPUs in processing or Memory of DB

Applications MUST be built in a scalable way.

Design for scale please
