# Understand elasticity

The word elastic - expand or contract

the cloud is elastic

Fixed Capacity - planning is also needed to make these changes

## Manual Scaling

* when launching an app, you need to plan server space
  * takes time
* monitor and maintain the server traffic
  * respond to too much traffic
  * respong to too few servers
* got to be a better way

## Enter the cloud

* supply aligns with demand
* auto scaling to server
* usage is the measure to respond using server space
* traffic picks up and we scale up
* CPU utilization
  * when above a threshold the app can scale out with more cores
  * the reverse is true, too little traffic and it can scale in with less cores

Elasticity is on of the fundamental properties of the cloud
